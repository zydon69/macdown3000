# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

Changes proposed in #597; these are not a published release.

### Added

- Source-preserving preview editing: select rendered text to format it, or explicitly replace supported text, while keeping Markdown as the document source.
- Independent formatting scopes for inline styles, line types and callout/disclosure containers. A heading inside a callout can retain its own inline formatting.
- Normal text, task list and fenced code toolbar actions alongside the existing heading, list and inline code controls.
- Optional long-code-line wrapping in the preview, styled HTML export and Quick Look, without changing the code text.
- System, Light and Dark application appearance settings, independent of the document theme.
- An optional live reading-position percentage alongside the word count, following the pane being scrolled.
- Five Quarto-style callout types, localized default titles, nesting and collapsible blocks through the shared Markdown renderer.
- 37 bundled community palettes with coordinated editor, preview and Prism variants, credits and offline resources.
- Find in rendered preview content and folder opening through the existing workspace browser.

### Changed

- Use the same source-validated conversion engine for toolbar actions and preview formatting, preserving undo and neighboring content.
- Combine line and container choices in one text dropdown with a separator between groups. Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, inline code, clear formatting, link and edit-text actions use icons with hover labels.
- Open the formatting panel after mouse release, show only common selection styles in blue, and retain compatible selections across successive commands.
- Make editor and preview text selections mutually exclusive so toolbar actions target the active pane.
- Write sequential numbers for ordered lists in the Markdown source.

### Fixed

- Restore preview text selection and the formatting panel on multiline quotations, including mixed styles and repeated text, while preserving Markdown provenance.
- Preserve nested quote, heading and list prefixes when adding or removing inline styles inside quotations.
- Replace duplicate task-list bullets with checkboxes and align task text with ordinary list text. Position checkbox markers using the list font, including enlarged text and dark themes.
- Preserve callout containers when changing their content's line type; explicit removal keeps titles, content and neighboring block boundaries intact.
- Preserve the live expanded/collapsed state of generated disclosures during ordinary preview refreshes; explicit Reload restores source defaults.
- Convert supported fenced code back to ordinary text and remove quote prefixes when converting quotations to code. Reject incompatible inline formatting in literal code blocks.
- Preserve Setext heading metadata during cross-block formatting, entire long paragraphs during container changes, and localized titles when creating previously untitled disclosures.
- Apply toolbar links to the active pane's selection, preserving formatting and selection on cancellation or rejected URLs.
- Load required Prism language components on the first code preview and improve multiline heading spacing.
- Prevent stale render/file callbacks and unsafe editor mutations from overwriting current document state; preserve selection, change notifications and undo.
- Correct HTML/PDF export completion, resource refreshes, Quick Look preferences and packaged versions, localization and word counting across inline styles.

### Security

- Harden clipboard and URL validation, document-relative file creation and resource resolution against invalid inputs and symlink escapes.
- Bound parser and YAML graph processing, reject stale or forged preview editing requests, and validate rewritten Markdown with the renderer before applying it.
- Serialize command-line requests through a private queue and strengthen release artifact identity, signing and recovery checks.

### Infrastructure

- Add regression coverage for formatting compositions and transitions, real-WebView menus, list geometry, export and Quick Look. Detailed execution results and limits are recorded in the audit and feature reports; historical checks are not claimed as rerun for every subsequent change.

## [3000.0.7] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Show a live word/character/character-no-spaces count for the current editor selection in the count widget, reverting to document totals when nothing is selected (#452)

### Security

- Restrict auto-created link targets to the current document's folder to prevent unauthorized file creation (#386)

### Fixed

- Fix a potential crash (EXC_BAD_ACCESS) reaching the editor through a dangling `MPDocument.editor` outlet, by making it a weak reference instead of `unsafe_unretained` (#1379) -- thanks @wltb (Roberto Bissanti) for the contribution!
- Fix Homebrew detection in the Terminal preferences pane, which never actually worked: the subprocess launched a bare `brew` path that NSTask cannot resolve (it does not search `PATH`), so the check failed silently every time; MacDown now resolves Homebrew's absolute location before launching and modernizes the subprocess around `NSTask.terminationHandler` to avoid a preferences-pane hang risk (#526, #1379) -- thanks @wltb (Roberto Bissanti) for the contribution!
- Replace deprecated `-insertText:` with `-insertText:replacementRange:` at the editor autocomplete and new-paragraph insertion sites (#1379) -- thanks @wltb (Roberto Bissanti) for the contribution!
- Remove stale `location`/`supportText` outlet connections in the Terminal preferences nib that logged a "Failed to connect outlet" warning on every load (#1379) -- thanks @wltb (Roberto Bissanti) for the contribution!
- Fix spurious "changed by another application" save conflicts and save failures on remote/FUSE-mounted volumes (e.g. SSHFS) by bypassing NSDocument's atomic temp-file-swap save for non-local destinations and writing directly instead; this should also stop the "does not support permanent version storage" prompt from appearing for those documents, since it's raised from the same code path (#371) -- thanks @gurple for the report!
- Fix the Insert Table toolbar button doing nothing when the editor pane had focus, and corrupting the document when clicked repeatedly (a second table was inserted inside the first table's cell); every click now inserts a clean, well-separated table regardless of which pane has focus (#278) -- thanks @rcuisnier for the report!
- Fix auto-reload silently breaking after an external editor's atomic save by making the local-volume watcher check fall back to the parent directory when the file is transiently missing; also guard resource-file watchers against remote volumes and tear down any prior watcher before re-arming (#478)
- Fix the Preview pane still auto-scrolling toward the editor when typing after Sync Panes was turned off mid-session; toggling Sync Panes now takes effect immediately (settling the panes on disable, re-syncing on enable) without needing to reopen the document (#441) -- thanks @gregwillits!
- Fix blank preview when opening saved or externally-originated documents: the real document file is no longer used as the preview's base resource, which WebKit on macOS 26 can silently refuse to load (e.g. files with the execute bit set by sync clients like OneDrive, or stale TCC/provenance state) (#431, #405) -- thanks @maskedspitz, @songjianbupt, and @craigrodger for the diagnosis!
- Improve render-path responsiveness: single-pass word/character counting, cached body-extraction regex, and bounded renderer polling with cancellation (#388)
- Restrict auto-created link targets to the current document's folder scope (#388)
- Fix line enumeration in scroll sync header scanning to handle `\r\n` and bare `\r` line endings (#388)

<!-- rc-temp -->

### Known Issues

- On French and other localized builds, the Compilation tab of the Preferences window has a layout regression where the code-block syntax-coloration control overlaps adjacent text. This is cosmetic and does not affect functionality. Tracked in #397 and targeted for 3000.0.8.

## [3000.0.6] - 2026-04-18

This release rebuilds scroll sync around an ownership model that eliminates timing-based race conditions, and fixes several user-reported bugs with preview rendering, Quick Look, and diagram support.
