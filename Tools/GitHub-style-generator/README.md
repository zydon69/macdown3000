# GitHub Style Generator

Generates the MacDown GitHub stylesheet from the pinned `@primer/css` package.
Node.js 20.19 or newer and npm are required by the pinned Sass compiler.

From this directory:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
make
```

The repository `setup.sh` installs these dependencies as well. Xcode runs the
generator once in the shared resources target before the app and Quick Look
consume its output. Failed Sass compilation preserves the existing stylesheet
and stops the build.

To update the upstream style deliberately, change dependencies in `package.json`,
run `npm install` to update `package-lock.json`, then regenerate and review the CSS.
