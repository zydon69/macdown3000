# Reproduce the intermittent test-host stall that shows up on GitHub Actions runners.
#
# Symptom: a test emits "Test Case '…' started." and the run goes silent. Sometimes
# XCTest's execution-time-allowance watchdog fires and recovers the suite, sometimes it
# fires and the host never resumes, sometimes it never reports at all. On CI this costs
# either a watchdog recovery or the whole job timeout.
#
# The trigger is scheduling pressure, not GitHub. Running the suite at background QoS
# (taskpolicy -b) starves the test host for CPU and I/O and reproduces the stall on
# developer hardware, where it otherwise never appears. Background QoS is used rather than
# saturating the machine so foreground apps stay responsive while this runs.
#
# Observed victims are tests that wait on real asynchronous delivery inside a timed wait —
# MPWordCountUpdateTests, MPResourceWatcherSetTests, MPPreviewViewControllerTests. The
# specific victim varies between runs; what stays constant is that one of them wedges.
#
# usage: Tools/repro-stall.sh [iterations] [allowance_seconds]
#
#   iterations  how many full-suite runs to attempt (default 12)
#   allowance   -maximum-test-execution-time-allowance, seconds (default 60). Lower values
#               surface a wedge faster; too low and a merely-slow test is misreported.
#
# Each run is classified:
#   ok     tests executed, no wedge
#   WEDGE  watchdog fired and/or the host restarted; the victim is named
#   FAIL   test/build command failed after running tests
#   NORUN  no tests executed at all (usually a build failure — run `bundle exec pod install`).
#          This case exists because a build failure produces no wedge markers and would
#          otherwise be scored as a pass.
